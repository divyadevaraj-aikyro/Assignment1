python3 -m http.server 8000
```

Or using Node.js:
```bash
npx serve .
```

3. Open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser

## üéØ Learning Objectives

This application is designed to help you practice:

- Debug JavaScript syntax and logical errors
- Fix CSS display and styling issues
- Troubleshoot DOM manipulation problems
- Use browser developer tools for systematic debugging
- Practice modular debugging techniques
- Understand localStorage data persistence issues

## üîç Debugging Approach

### Step 1: Initial Assessment
1. Open the application in your browser
2. Check the browser console (F12 ‚Üí Console tab) for JavaScript errors
3. Test basic functionality: try to add a note, switch themes, use search

### Step 2: Systematic Debugging Process

1. **JavaScript Errors First**:
   - Fix any syntax errors preventing initialization
   - Check console for runtime errors
   - Verify all methods are properly defined

2. **Core Functionality**:
   - Fix note creation and display
   - Resolve modal issues
   - Test CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)

3. **UI/UX Issues**:
   - Fix CSS display problems
   - Resolve theme switching
   - Test responsive design

4. **Data Persistence**:
   - Verify localStorage operations
   - Test data saving and loading
   - Check theme persistence

### Step 3: Comprehensive Testing
1. Create, edit, and delete notes
2. Test search and filter functionality
3. Verify theme switching and persistence
4. Test mobile responsiveness
5. Check error handling for edge cases

## üõ†Ô∏è Using Claude Code for Debugging

### Helpful Debugging Prompts:

1. **JavaScript Syntax Errors**:
   ```
   "check the javascript syntax in script.js and identify any syntax errors or missing initialization code"
   ```

2. **Modal Issues**:
   ```
   "the modals in my note app are not working correctly. help me debug the modal display logic in both the CSS and JavaScript"
   ```

3. **CSS Display Problems**:
   ```
   "the note cards are not showing up in my app. check the CSS for .note-card and related display properties"
   ```

4. **localStorage Issues**:
   ```
   "the dark mode theme is not persisting after page refresh. help me debug the theme saving and loading functionality"
   ```

5. **Functionality Problems**:
   ```
   "I can't create or edit notes properly. help me debug the saveNote method and related functionality"
   ```

6. **Step-by-Step Debugging**:
   ```
   "walk me through debugging this note taking app systematically. start with the most critical issues and work through them one by one"
   ```

- **Empty States**: Verify empty state displays correctly
- **Responsive Design**: Test on mobile and tablet viewports
- **Error Handling**: Test edge cases and invalid inputs

## üí° Tips for Success

1. **Use Browser DevTools**: Console, Elements, and Application tabs are essential
2. **Check Console First**: JavaScript errors often point directly to the problem
3. **Test Incrementally**: Fix one issue at a time and test each fix
4. **Use Claude Code Effectively**: Ask specific questions about errors you're seeing
5. **Understand the Code Flow**: Read through the code to understand how it should work
6. **Check CSS and JavaScript**: Some issues may be in styling rather than logic

## üîó Common Debugging Commands

**Browser Console**:
- `document.querySelectorAll('.note-card')` - Check if note cards exist
- `localStorage.getItem('notes')` - Check stored notes
- `noteApp` - Check if app object exists
- `noteApp.notes` - View current notes array

**Claude Code Debugging**:
- "Check for JavaScript errors in my code"
- "Help me fix the modal functionality"
- "Why are my note cards not displaying?"
- "Debug the theme switching functionality"

Good luck, and enjoy the debugging process! üêõ‚û°Ô∏è‚úÖ
